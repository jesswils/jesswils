                                         I'm Jess ðŸ˜„ a Junior Developer 

<br>

I started self-learning software development over a year ago after I left my last corporate job, building on the skills I had with HTML5 and CSS3, moving onto JavaScript and later to Dart and Flutter. I've always been interested in design and technology ~~(playing video games counts, right?)~~ and now I get to do it as a job! 
<br>
<br>
Although I'm only at the start of my career, I'm a fast learner and I want to develop my skills and knowledge to build excellent software.
